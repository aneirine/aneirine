### Hi, I'm Anna 👋🇺🇦


👩‍💻 I'm working as a Java Backend Developer using Spring Framework.
For a long time, I was passionate about developing applications for Android.📱

🍃 I’m currently learning reactive web on Spring (WebFlux) and microservice architecture, which i already like a lot.
Like programming, but have no idea what to code. So, if you have one or you need backend for your project just write me.
